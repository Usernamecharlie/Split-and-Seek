# 1. Title and Short Description
### Binary Search Visualizer
This project is an interactive web application that visually simulates the **Binary Search** algorithm. Built using **Python** and the **Gradio** UI library, it is designed to help students understand the "Divide and Conquer" strategy by animating how the search space is repeatedly halved until a target value is found.

# 2. Demo Screenshot or GIF
Below is the application in action, successfully finding the target value **11**.

### How to Read the Visualization
To make the algorithm easy to follow, I have used a specific color legend:
* **⬜ White:** **Active Range** (The candidate pool where the target might be).
* **🟨 Yellow:** **Current Midpoint** (The number currently being compared to the target).
* **⬜ Grey:** **Discarded** (Elements proven impossible, so we ignore them).
* **🟩 Green:** **Target Found!** (Success).

# 3. Algorithm Name and Overview
I have chosen to implement the **Binary Search** algorithm.

**Overview:**
Binary search is an efficient method for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.

**Time Complexity & Efficiency:**
* **Binary Search:** Runs in **$O(\log n)$** time. Because it discards half the list at every step, it is exponentially faster than linear methods for large datasets.
* **Linear Search:** Runs in **$O(n)$** time.
* **Visual Difference:** This app demonstrates this efficiency visually—you will see the "active range" cut in half with every single step, proving how fast it discards impossible values.

**Real-World Applications:**
Understanding this algorithm is crucial because it powers many real-world systems:
* **Database Indexing:** Finding a specific record among millions.
* **Dictionaries:** Quickly locating a word in a sorted physical or digital book.
* **Debugging:** Tools like `git bisect` use binary search to find the specific commit that introduced a bug.

# 4. Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking
To translate the abstract logic of Binary Search into this interactive tool, I applied the four pillars of computational thinking:

### Decomposition
I broke the algorithm down into distinct stages that map directly to the code components:
1.  **Input & Validation:** Parsing the comma-separated string, converting to integers, and handling errors (e.g., empty input).
2.  **Initialization:** Sorting the list and setting initial pointers (`low`, `high`, `mid`).
3.  **Calculation:** Computing the midpoint: `mid = (low + high) // 2`.
4.  **Comparison:** Evaluating if `arr[mid]` is equal to, less than, or greater than the target.
5.  **Termination:** Deciding whether to return a success index, discard a half, or declare the item "not found."

### Pattern Recognition
The algorithm relies on a repeating pattern that occurs regardless of list size:
> *Calculate Mid $\rightarrow$ Compare to Target $\rightarrow$ Discard Half $\rightarrow$ Repeat.*

In my app, the **"Next Step"** button triggers exactly one iteration of this pattern. Whether the list has 10 items or 10,000, this same cycle repeats until the end condition is met. This reinforces the concept of a loop to the user.

### Abstraction
I consciously chose what to show and what to hide to avoid overwhelming the user:
* **Shown (User Model):** The list of numbers, the "active window" (white boxes), and simple text explanations (e.g., "Target is larger, go right").
* **Hidden (System Model):** The technical details of string parsing, integer division math, array memory management, and `try/except` error catching.

### Algorithm Design
The application follows a strict **Input $\rightarrow$ Process $\rightarrow$ Output** flow:
* **Input:** User enters a comma-separated list and a target value.
* **Process:** The app executes one binary search step at a time, updating indices.
* **Output:** The visualization updates colors, and the log displays the decision logic.

**Session State (Gradio):**
Crucially, I used `gr.State` to manage the application's memory.
* **Why?** Standard functions "forget" variables after they run. Without state, the app would reset every time the user clicked "Next Step."
* **What is stored?** The state dictionary holds the `list`, `low` index, `high` index, `mid` index, `found_index`, and `step_count`. This allows the app to resume exactly where it left off between button clicks.

    Compare -- Mid > Target --> Right[Discard Right Half: High = Mid - 1] --> UpdateState
    
    UpdateState --> Wait


# 6. Data Types and Structures
As per the project requirements, I explicitly state the data structures used:

* **The List:** Stored as a **Python List of Integers** (e.g., `[1, 5, 8, 12]`).
* **The Target:** Stored as a single **Integer**.
* **The Algorithm State:** Stored in a **Dictionary** passed to `gr.State`. This dictionary acts as the app's persistent memory and contains:
    * `arr`: The sorted list of integers.
    * `target`: The integer target value.
    * `low`, `high`: Integer indices defining the active search range.
    * `mid`: Integer index of the current midpoint (or `None`).
    * `found_index`: Integer index where the target was found (or `None`).
    * `step_count`: Integer counter for the number of steps taken.
    * `finished`: Boolean flag to stop the search loop.
    * `log`: String containing the history of steps for the UI display.

# 8. Testing and Verification Section
I performed extensive testing to ensure the algorithm handles standard and edge cases correctly.

| Test Case | Expected Outcome | Actual Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target in Middle** | Highlight Yellow, then Green immediately. | ✅ **Success** (Found in 1 step). |
| **Target at Start/End** | Algorithm should narrow down to index 0 or N-1. | ✅ **Success** (Correctly found at bounds). |
| **Target Not Present** | `low` becomes > `high`, log says "Not Found". | ✅ **Success** (See Figure 3 below). |
| **Single Element List** | Works normally for list of length 1. | ✅ **Success** (Handled correctly). |
| **Empty Input** | Warning message, no crash. | ✅ **Success** (See Figure 2 below). |
| **Unsorted Input** | App should sort it automatically. | ✅ **Success** (List appeared sorted in UI). |
